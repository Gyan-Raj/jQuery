    <title>Avoiding Conflicts with Other Libraries</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The jQuery library and virtually all of its plugins are contained within
      the jQuery namespace. As a general rule, global objects are stored inside
      the jQuery namespace as well, so you shouldn't get a clash between jQuery
      and any other library (like prototype.js, MooTools, or YUI).
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, there is one caveat/warning :
      <b
        >by default, jQuery uses $ as a shortcut for jQuery. Thus, if you are
        using another JavaScript library that uses the $ variable, you can run
        into conflicts with jQuery.</b
      >
      In order to avoid these conflicts, you need to put jQuery in no-conflict
      mode immediately after it is loaded onto the page and before you attempt
      to use jQuery in your page.
    </p>
    <ol>
      In order to avoid these conflicts, we can choose any of the following
      ways:
      <li>
        Put jQuery in no-conflict mode immediately after it is loaded onto the
        page and before you attempt to use jQuery in your page.
        <strong>-i.e., Create a New Alias</strong>
        <br />
        -when you put jQuery into no-conflict mode, you have the option of
        assigning a new variable name to replace the $ alias.
        <br />
        <pre><code>
            &lt;!-- Putting jQuery into no-conflict mode. --&gt;
            &lt;script src="prototype.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;script&gt;
            
            var $j = jQuery.noConflict();
            // $j is now an alias to the jQuery function; creating the new alias is optional.
            
            $j(document).ready(function() {
                $j( "h1" ).hide();
            });
            
            // The $ variable now has the prototype meaning, which is a shortcut for
            // document.getElementByTagName(). div below is a DOM element, not a jQuery object.
            window.onload = function() {
                var div = jQuery("div");
                console.log(div);
            }
            
            &lt;/script&gt;
            </code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you don't want to define another alternative to the full jQuery
        function name (you really like to use $ and don't care about using the
        other library's $ method), then there's still another approach you might
        try: <br />
        -simply add the $ as an argument passed to your jQuery( document
        ).ready() function.
        <strong
          >-i.e., Use the Argument That's Passed to the jQuery( document
          ).ready() Function</strong
        >
        This is most frequently used in the case where you still want the
        benefits of really concise jQuery code, but don't want to cause
        conflicts with other libraries. <br />This is probably the ideal
        solution for most of your code, considering that there'll be less code
        that you'll have to change in order to achieve complete compatibility.
        <pre><code>
            &lt;!-- Another way to put jQuery into no-conflict mode. --&gt;
            &lt;script src=&quot;prototype.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;script src=&quot;jquery.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;script&gt;
            
            jQuery.noConflict();
            
            jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
                // You can use the locally-scoped $ in here as an alias to jQuery.
                $( "h1" ).hide();
            });
            
            // The $ variable in the global scope now has the prototype.js meaning or its default behavior.
            // To avoid conflict, use jQuery or another alias in the global scope.
            window.onload = function() {
                // Use jQuery directly or define an alias in the global scope
                var div = jQuery("div");
                console.log(div);
            }
            
            &lt;/script&gt;
            </code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use an Immediately Invoked Function Expression <br />You can continue to
        use the standard $ by wrapping your code in an immediately invoked
        function expression; this is also a standard pattern for jQuery plugin
        authoring, where the author cannot know whether another library will
        have taken over the $ <br />
        <pre><code>
            &lt;!-- Using the $ inside an immediately-invoked function expression. --&gt;
            &lt;script src=&quot;prototype.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;script src=&quot;jquery.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
            &lt;script&gt;
            
            jQuery.noConflict();
            
            (function( $ ) {
                // Your jQuery code here, using the $
            })( jQuery );
            
            &lt;/script&gt;
            </code></pre>
      </li>
