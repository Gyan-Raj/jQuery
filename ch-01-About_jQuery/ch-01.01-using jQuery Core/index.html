      <p>
        In jQuery, there is an important distinction between methods associated
        with jQuery objects and methods that belong to the jQuery library
        itself. This distinction can be understood through two main namespaces:
        $.fn and $.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>jQuery Object Methods ($.fn Namespace)</h3>
      <p>
        Methods that operate on jQuery objects are defined in the $.fn
        namespace, also known as the jQuery prototype.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Most jQuery methods (like .css(), .click(), .remove()) are called on
          jQuery objects, like $( "h1" ).remove(). These methods are part of the
          $.fn namespace, or the "jQuery prototype."
          <ul>
            <li>
              The jQuery prototype, denoted as $.fn, is an object where all
              jQuery object methods are defined. This allows all jQuery objects
              to share methods efficiently through the prototype.
            </li>
            <li>
              In summary, $.fn is the namespace where jQuery stores all its
              object methods, making it central to the functionality and
              extensibility of the library.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some methods do not act on a selection; these are part of the
              jQuery namespace and are considered core jQuery methods.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>What it is:</b> The $.fn namespace contains methods that can be
          called on jQuery objects. A jQuery object is a wrapper around a set of
          DOM elements, created when you select elements using the $() function,
          such as $("h1").
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>How it works:</b> When you call a method like .remove() on a jQuery
          object ($("h1").remove()), you are using a method from the $.fn
          namespace. These methods automatically receive the selected elements
          as this, allowing them to perform actions like manipulating the DOM.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Example:</b> In $( "h1" ).remove();, the remove() method is called
          on a jQuery object containing <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements,
          removing them from the DOM.
        </li>
        <b>NOTE:</b>
        We added "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", etc., to the end of each < li >
        element using the jQuery Object Method (.each(), part of the $.fn
        namespace)
      </ul>

      <h3>Core jQuery Methods (Utility Methods, $ Namespace)</h3>
      <p>
        These methods are part of the core jQuery library and are directly
        available on the jQuery object (represented by $).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>What it is:</b> The $ namespace contains utility methods that are
          part of the core jQuery library. These methods are not called on
          jQuery objects; they serve broader purposes like handling data,
          events, or performing operations not tied to specific DOM elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>How it works:</b> These methods do not operate on a selection of
          elements and do not automatically receive any particular context
          (this). Their return values and behavior can vary based on their
          design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Example:</b> The method $.each() is a utility function that
          iterates over arrays or objects. Unlike .each(), which is called on a
          jQuery object, $.each() is a general-purpose utility method.
          <p>
            <code>
              $.each([ "foo", "bar", "baz" ], function( idx, val ) {
              console.log( "element " + idx + " is " + val ); });<br />
              $.each({ foo: "bar", baz: "bim" }, function( k, v ) { console.log(
              k + " : " + v ); });
            </code>
            <br />
            <b>NOTE:</b> .each(), not $.each(), should be used for iterating
            over elements in a selection.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>NOTE:</b> The distinction between object methods and utility methods
      can be confusing. Remember:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Object Methods (like .each()): Called on a jQuery object to manipulate
          or interact with selected elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Utility Methods (like $.each()): Part of the core jQuery library and
          not tied to specific DOM elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some methods share names, such as $.each() and .each(). Always refer
          to the documentation for clarity.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b> We iterated through an array and an object and logged their
        values using Utility Method ($.each()).
