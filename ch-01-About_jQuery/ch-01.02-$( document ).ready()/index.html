      A page can't be manipulated safely until the document is "ready." jQuery
      detects this state of readiness for you. Code included inside $( document
      ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) is ready
      for JavaScript code to execute.
      <span style="color: red">whereas</span> Code included inside $( window
      ).on( "load", function() { ... }) will run once the entire page (images or
      iframes), not just the DOM, is ready.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        DOM Ready ($(document).ready()):
        <ul>
          <li>
            This event triggers when the DOM (Document Object Model) has been
            fully constructed, meaning that all HTML elements are available and
            can be manipulated. However, this does not necessarily mean that all
            external resources, like images, videos, or iframes, have finished
            loading.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is a good point to execute scripts that modify the DOM structure,
            handle event bindings, or initialize interactive elements, as the
            structure of the page is complete and all elements can be accessed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Window Load ($(window).on("load", function() { ... })):
        <ul>
          <li>
            This event triggers after the entire page, including all associated
            resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and iframes, has
            completely loaded.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is often used when you need to ensure that all external
            resources are fully loaded before executing certain scripts, such as
            image galleries, animations that depend on images, or anything else
            that relies on the complete loading of the entire page.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In summary, use $(document).ready() when you want to run code as soon as
      the DOM is ready, which is typically faster and sufficient for most
      JavaScript manipulations. Use $(window).on("load", function() { ... })
      when you need to wait for all page content to load, including external
      resources.
