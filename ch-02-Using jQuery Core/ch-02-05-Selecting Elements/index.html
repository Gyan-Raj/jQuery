        -The most basic concept of jQuery is to "select some elements and do
        something with them." <br />
        -jQuery supports most <u><b>CSS3 selectors</b></u
        >, as well as some <u><b>non-standard selectors</b></u
        >.

      <h3>1. CSS3 selectors</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Selecting Elements by ID</li>
        <pre>
          <code>$( "#myId" ); // Note IDs must be unique per page.</code>
        </pre>
        <li>Selecting Elements by Class Name</li>
        <pre>
          <code>$( ".myClass" );</code>
        </pre>
        <li>Selecting Elements by Attribute</li>
        <pre>
          <code>$( "input[name='first_name']" );</code>
        </pre>
        <li>Selecting Elements by Compound CSS Selector</li>
        <pre>
          <code>$( "#contents ul.people li" );</code>
        </pre>
        <li>Selecting Elements with a Comma-separated List of Selectors</li>
        <pre>
          <code>$( "div.myClass, ul.people" );</code>
        </pre>
        <li>Pseudo-Selectors</li>
        <pre>
          <code>$( "a.external:first" );
          $( "tr:odd" );
           
          // Select all input-like elements in a form (more on this below).
          $( "#myForm :input" );
          $( "div:visible" );
           
          // All except the first three divs.
          $( "div:gt(2)" );
           
          // All currently animated divs.
          $( "div:animated" );</code>
        </pre>
        <b>NOTE: </b>
        When using the :visible and :hidden pseudo-selectors, jQuery tests the
        actual visibility of the element, not its CSS visibility or display
        properties.
        <br />
        jQuery looks to see if the element's physical height and width on the
        page are both greater than zero.
        <br />
        <b>However,</b>
        this test doesn't work with < tr > elements. In the case of < tr >
        jQuery does check the CSS display property, and considers an element
        hidden if its display property is set to none.
        <br />
        <b>Also,</b>
        elements that have not been added to the DOM will always be considered
        hidden, even if the CSS that would affect them would render them
        visible.
      </ol>

      <h3>2. non-standard selectors</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>#Does My Selection Contain Any Elements?</h3>
      <p>
        Once you've made a selection, you'll often want to know whether you have
        anything to work with. A common mistake is to use:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>if ( $( "div.foo" ) ) {
            ...
          }
          </code>
        </pre>
      <b>-This Doesn't work!</b>
      <p>
        When a selection is made using $(), an object is always returned, and
        objects always evaluate to true. Even if the selection doesn't contain
        any elements, the code inside the if statement will still run.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to determine if there are any elements is to test the
        selection's .length property, which tells you how many elements were
        selected. If the answer is 0, the .length property will evaluate to
        false when used as a boolean value:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
        // Testing whether a selection contains elements.
          if ( $( "div.foo" ).length ) {
              ...
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h3>#Saving Selections</h3>
      <p>
        jQuery doesn't cache elements for you. If you've made a selection that
        you might need to make again, you should save the selection in a
        variable rather than making the selection repeatedly.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          var divs = $( "div" );
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Once the selection is stored in a variable, you can call jQuery methods
        on the variable just like you would have called them on the original
        selection.
      </p>
      <h3>#Refining & Filtering Selections</h3>
      <p>
        jQuery offers several methods for refining and filtering selections.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
        // Refining selections.
          $( "div.foo" ).has( "p" );         // div.foo elements that contain < p > tags
          $( "h1" ).not( ".bar" );           // h1 elements that don't have a class of bar
          $( "ul li" ).filter( ".current" ); // unordered list items with class of current
          $( "ul li" ).first();              // just the first unordered list item
          $( "ul li" ).eq( 5 );              // the sixth
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h3>#Selecting Form Elements</h3>
      <p>
        jQuery offers several pseudo-selectors that help find elements in forms.
        These are especially helpful because it can be difficult to distinguish
        between form elements based on their state or type using standard CSS
        selectors.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>:checked</li>
        <p>
          Not to be confused with :checkbox, :checked targets checked
          <b>checkboxes</b>, but keep in mind that this selector works also for
          checked <b>radio buttons</b>, and <b>< select ></b> elements <br />
          <b>NOTE: </b>for < select > elements only, use the :selected selector
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            $( "form :checked" );
          </code>
        </pre>
        <li>:disabled</li>
        <p>
          Using the :disabled pseudo-selector targets any < input > elements
          with the disabled attribute:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            $( "form :disabled" );
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In order to get the best performance using :disabled, first select
          elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use .filter(
          ":disabled" )
        </p>
        <li>:enabled</li>
        <p>
          Basically the inverse of the :disabled pseudo-selector, the :enabled
          pseudo-selector targets any elements that do not have a disabled
          attribute:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            $( "form :enabled" );
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In order to get the best performance using :enabled, first select
          elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use .filter( ":enabled"
          )
        </p>
        <li>:input</li>
        <p>
          Using the :input selector selects all <b>< input ></b> ,<b
            >< textarea ></b
          >
          , <b>< select ></b>, and <b>< button ></b> elements:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            $( "form :input" );
          </code>
        </pre>
        <li>:selected</li>
        <p>
          Using the :selected pseudo-selector targets any selected items in <
          option > elements:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            $( "form :selected" );
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In order to get the best performance using :selected, first select
          elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use .filter(
          ":selected" )
        </p>
        <li>Selecting by type</li>
        jQuery provides pseudo selectors to select form-specific elements
        according to their type:
        <ul>
          <li>:password</li>
          <li>:reset</li>
          <li>:radio</li>
          <li>:text</li>
          <li>:submit</li>
          <li>:checkbox</li>
          <li>:button</li>
          <li>:image</li>
          <li>:file</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
    </div>
