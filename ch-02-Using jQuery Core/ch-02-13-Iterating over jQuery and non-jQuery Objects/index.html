      <p>
        jQuery provides an object iterator utility called $.each() as well as a
        jQuery collection iterator: .each().
        <b>These are not interchangeable</b>. In addition, there are a couple of
        helpful methods called $.map() and .map() that can shortcut one of our
        common iteration use cases.

      <h3>Iterating over non-jQuery Objects</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          $.each(): -it is essentially a drop-in replacement of a traditional
          for or for-in loop
        </li>
        <p>
          $.each() is a generic iterator function for looping over object,
          arrays, and array-like objects.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Plain objects are iterated via their named properties</li>
          <pre>
            <code>
              var sum = 0;
              var obj = {
                ele1: 1,
                ele2: 2,
                ele3: 3,
                ele4: 4,
                ele5: 5,
              };

              //using for-in loop
              for (let value in obj) {
                sum += obj[value];
              }
              console.log(sum); // 15

              //we can replace this for-in loop with $.each() as:
              $.each(obj, (key, value) => (sum += value));
              console.log(sum); // 15
              <b>NOTE: </b>Noteice that we don't have to directly access obj[ value ] as the value is passed directly to the callback
            </code>
          </pre>
          <li>Arrays and array-like objects are iterated via their indices.</li>
          <pre>
            <code>
              var sum = 0;
              var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

              //using for loop
              for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                sum += arr[i];
              }
              console.log(sum); // 15

              //we can replace this for loop with $.each() as:
              $.each(arr, (index, value) => (sum += value));
              console.log(sum); // 15
              <b>NOTE: </b>Notice that we don't have to access arr[ index ] as the value is conveniently passed to the callback in $.each().

        <li>
          $.map(): works on plain JavaScript arrays. Because it's working on a
          plain array, $.map() returns a plain array, and .get() does not need
          to be called - in fact, it will throw an error as it's not a native
          JavaScript method.
        </li>
        <p>
          A word of warning: $.map() switches the order of callback arguments.
          This was done in order to match the native JavaScript .map() method
          made available in ECMAScript 5.
        </p>

          <code>
            var arr = [
                        {
                          id: "a",
                          tagName: "li",
                        },

      <h3>Iterating over jQuery Objects</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>.each(): it is used directly on a jQuery collection.</li>
        <p>
          It iterates over each matched element in the collection and performs a
          callback on that object. The index of the current element within the
          collection is passed as an argument to the callback. The value/element
          (the DOM element in this case) is also passed, but the callback is
          fired within the context of the current matched element so the this
          keyword points to the current element as expected in other jQuery
          callbacks.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            $("li").each(function (index, element) {
              console.log($(this).text());
            });
          </code>
        </pre>
        <li>.map(): works on jQuery element collections.</li>
        <p>
          Anytime we want to create an array or concatenated string based on all
          matched elements in our jQuery selector, we're better served using
          .map()
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            $("li")
              .map(function (index, element) {
                console.log(this.text());
              })
              .get();
