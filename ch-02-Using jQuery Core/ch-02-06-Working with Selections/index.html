      <p>
        Some jQuery methods can be used to either assign or to read some value
        on a selection.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the method is called with a value as an argument, it's referred to
        as a <b>setter</b> because it sets (or assigns) that value
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            $("h1").html("NOTE: the headings (h3) are written using jQuery and not in index.html, also, this text is also written by jQuery");
        // The .html() method sets all the h1 elements' html to be "NOTE: the headings (h3) are written using jQuery and not in index.html, also, this text is also written by jQuery";
        </code>
    </pre>
      <p>
        When the method is called with no argument, it gets (or reads) the value
        of the element and is therefore called <b>getter</b>
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            // The .html() method returns the html of the first h3 element:
            let h3 = $("h3").html();
            console.log(h3); //Getters & Setters
        </code>
    </pre>
      <p>
        <b>NOTE: </b><b>Setters</b> affect all elements in a selection,
        <b>whereas, getters</b>
        return the requested value only for the first element in the selection,
        <b>with the exception of .text()</b>, which retrieves the values of all
        the elements.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            let p = $("p").text();
            console.log(p); //=>this will give all the text of p tags
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>
        If you call a method on a selection and that method returns a jQuery
        object, you can continue to call jQuery methods on the object without
        pausing for a semicolon. This practice is referred to as "chaining":
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            $("body").find("h3").eq(1).html("Chaining");
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b>Setters return a jQuery object, allowing you to continue
        calling jQuery methods on your selection i.e., can chain the methods for
        setters. <b>BUT,</b> Getters return whatever they were asked to get, so
        you can't continue to call jQuery methods on the value returned by the
        getter, i.e., can't chain the methods for getters.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            i.e., 
            // Attempting to call a jQuery method after calling a getter.
            $("h1").html().addClass("test"); // Attempting to call a jQuery method after calling a getter. i.e., chaining does not work for getters => gives us ERROR
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>
        jQuery also provides the .end() method to get back to the original
        selection should you change the selection in the middle of a chain:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            $("body")
                .find("h3")
                .eq(2)
                .html(".end() method")
                .end() // Restores the selection to all h3s in body
                .eq(0)
                .html("Getters & Setters");
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <h1></h1>
    <h1></h1>
    <script src="../jQuery/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="./app.js"></script>
