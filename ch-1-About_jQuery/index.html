    <p>
      One important thing to know is that jQuery is just a JavaScript library
    </p>
    <p>
      jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes
      things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling,
      animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across
      a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and
      extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write
      JavaScript.
    </p>
    <h3>Launching Code on Document Ready</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To ensure that their code runs after the browser finishes loading the
        document, many JavaScript programmers wrap their code in an onload
        function: window.onload = function() { alert( "welcome" ); };
      </li>
      <li>
        Unfortunately, the code doesn't run until all images are finished
        downloading, including banner ads. To run code as soon as the document
        is ready to be manipulated, jQuery has a statement known as the
        <a href="http://api.jquery.com/ready/" id="readyEvent">ready event:</a>
        $( document ).ready(function() { // Your code here. });
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> The jQuery library exposes its methods and properties via two
      properties of the window object called jQuery and $. $ is simply an alias
      for jQuery and it's often employed because it's shorter and faster to
      write.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, inside the ready event, you can add a click handler to the
      link: $(document).ready(function () { $("#readyEvent").click(function
      (event) { alert("Thanks for visiting!"); }); }); <br />
      Clicking the link should now first display an alert pop-up, then continue
      with the default behavior of navigating to http://api.jquery.com/ready/
    </p>
    <h3>Adding and Removing an HTML Class</h3>
    <p>
      add some style information into the < head > of the document, like this: <
      style > a.test { font-weight: bold; } < / style >
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, add the .addClass() call to the script: $( "a" ).addClass( "test" );
      All < a > elements are now bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      To remove an existing class, use .removeClass(): $( "a" ).removeClass(
      "test" );
    </p>
    <h3>Special Effects</h3>
    <p>
      jQuery also provides some handy effects to help you make your web sites
      stand out. For example,
      <a
        href="https://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/"
        id="demo"
        >Demo</a
      >
      if you create a click handler of: $("#demo").click(function (event) {
      event.preventDefault(); $(this).hide("slow"); }); Then the link slowly
      disappears when clicked.
    </p>
    <h3>Callbacks and Functions</h3>
    <p>
      A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function
      and is executed after its parent function has completed. Callbacks are
      special because they patiently wait to execute until their parent
      finishes. Meanwhile, the browser can be executing other functions or doing
      all sorts of other work. <br />
      To use callbacks, it is important to know how to pass them into their
      parent function.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Callback without Arguments</h4></li>
      <p>
        If a callback has no arguments, you can pass it in like this:
        $.get("index.html", myCallBackWithoutArgument); When $.get() finishes
        getting the page index.html, it executes the myCallBackWithoutArgument()
        function.
        <br />
        <b>Note:</b> The second parameter here is simply the function name (but
        not as a string, <b>and without parentheses</b>).
      </p>
      <li>
        <h4>
          Callback with Arguments- Executing callbacks with arguments can be
          tricky.
        </h4>
      </li>
      <h6>Wrong- This code example will not work:</h6>
      <p>
        $.get( "index.html", myCallBackWithArgument( param1, param2 ) );
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason this fails is that the code executes myCallBackWithArgument(
        param1, param2 ) immediately and then passes myCallBackWithArgument()'s
        return value as the second parameter to $.get(). We actually want to
        pass the function myCallBackWithArgument(), not myCallBackWithArgument(
        param1, param2 )'s return value (which might or might not be a
        function). So, how to pass in myCallBackWithArgument() and include its
        arguments?
      </p>
      <h6>Right- This code example will not work:</h6>
      <p>
        To defer executing myCallBackWithArgument() with its parameters, you can
        use an anonymous function as a wrapper. Note the use of function() . The
        anonymous function does exactly one thing: calls
        myCallBackWithArgument(), with the values of param1 and param2.
      </p>
      <p>
        $.get( "index.html", function() { myCallBackWithArgument( param1, param2
        ); });
      </p>
      <p>
        When $.get() finishes getting the page index.html, it executes the
        anonymous function, which executes myCallBackWithArgument( param1,
        param2 ).
      </p>
